# ICRC-1 Auction

An auction canister for selling/buying ICRC1 fungible tokens


## Local setup

It is assumed that you have:
- Dfinity SDK installed
- NodeJS installed

Once you have cloned the repository, follow this process in your terminal:

1) In your project directory, run this command to install npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2) Start local Internet Computer replica:
```
dfx start --clean --background
```

3) Create canisters:

```
npm run create
```

4) If you want to use mocked ICRC1 ledger as quote ledger for debug purposes, put just created `icrc1_ledger_mock`
   canister id into `dfx.json::icrc1_auction->init_arg->first principal`

5) Setup and deploy canisters locally
```
npm run setup
```

6) Now you can use auction locally. Mocked ICRC1 ledger allows to create tokens out of thin air using `issueTokens` 
function. You should create at least one additional ICRC1 ledger in order to be able to place any bid/ask. This repo 
provides additional canister `icrc1_ledger_mock_2`, which you can register as another ICRC1 ledger in auction for testing

7) To start frontend in development mode, run: 
```
CANISTER_ID_ICRC1_AUCTION=<canister_id> npm run dev:frontend
```
Replace `<canister_id>` with your local auction canister id
